Tried to come up with random password generator basically utilising Math.random() functions.
the biggest challenge i face is to put the randomly generated letters or symbomls into the array and get random index out of it while only getting true boolean value (if user confirms true/false) 
There were many different youtube tutorials and codes on google I could use but I wanted to make it my way.
Its not complete however

thanky you
